          The days we used to sit in the car, and compare music interests. This
          phrase is the best, as I love the way you "say it" and not sing it.
          Times like these were just so theraputic, just to relax and listen to
          the track, and sometimes, you. Makes me wanna do it all over again,
          and never stop.

          This was a blast really, I always had fun doing these things with you.
          Nothing will ever replace theses memories, for sure. OMW and for
          introducing me to bubbleTea, best idea ever! Sunsets with you, alwas
          and forever!

          This is hands down the best thing I have ever been told. This coming
          from the most beautiful person on this planet. I felt like I was
          floating on a cloud taking me to the place where I belong.
