            <span class="leftq quotes">&ldquo;</span> Working with you, made me
            realise how fun we can make a serious situation. Look at the two of
            us, working together, sharing wonderful memories whilst on the job
            üòÅ and exploring each other in all sorts of environments. I don't
            think anyone looks as beautiful as you, when you're focused and
            working. I like the glasses vibe! <br /><br />
            You have a great road ahead profesionally, you inspire a lot of
            woman out there.

            <span class="leftq quotes">&ldquo;</span>I have been touched by an
            angel, truly. She came down from heaven, and spoke to my heart. That
            smile that would light up the entire South Africa during load
            shedding. The warm hug to keep you cold in the winter, but not the
            feet and hands üòÅ. The heart to love someone unconditionally, the
            will to keep on fighting for that love, the patience to allow and
            adapt to change. The mind of a genuis, and the body of a goddess.

            by the mistakes I have made, nothing can repair what I have caused,
            and what I have lost. I have truly experienced love in ways I was
            not used to, and I threw it away! Typical of me! I have a lot of
            regrets, but I do not and will never regret meeting you that day!
            The day I met the most beautiful woman in the world! I love you! and
            I always will. <br /><br />
            Please come back to me one day, I will be here, waiting for you.
